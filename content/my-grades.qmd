title: Grades and Reflection

# 3.1 and 3.2

This was our group so we presented and we were the ones grading.

# 3.3 and 3.4

### 0.95/1

Comments: " This person took all the notes and had answers with explanations"

Reflection: I think that I got a 0.95/1 because I gave a lot of effort. When they were explaining I took notes to make sure i understood the lesson when I did the hacks. I also went into more detail after I answered because I would struggle and needed it to explain it to myself. I wrote learning lessons after each problem and my overall thoughts and reflection. 

# 3.5 - 3.7
